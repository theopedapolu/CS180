colorize_skel.py is the only code file in this project and can be found in the code/ directory. It contains the code for reading
in images as well as automatically aligning, cropping, contrasting, and writing the output images. To run the code, put it in the same
directory as the set of images you want to align and run the command "python colorize_skel.py" This will generate a subdirectory called
outputs/ which contains the output images for each .jpg or .tif image in the directory.
