The code folder contains two code files: filters_and_frequencies.py, which contains all of the code for generating the images I made
 and align_image_code.py, which contains the code for aligning images when creating hybrid images. To run the code, uncomment the appropriate
subsection in the main() function of filters_and_frequencies.py and run the the python file. Make sure the images are in the same directory
as the python file. You should get an outputs/ folder which contains all of the output images.
